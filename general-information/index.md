# **Welcome!**

Hello and welcome everyone to the introduction page of our group session on "**Working collaborative with Jupyter Book: An open-source tool to create open and flexible teaching/learning materials**", at the "Openness in the Higher Education Classroom" Workshop on June 30th, 2025.  

My name is Lucie Binder, I'm a phd student at Goethe University and I'm also part of the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/intro.html) project that aims to provide open and free educational resources to promote key digital skills for working in empirical sciences. At the same time, we empower course instructors to take advantage of interactive, flexible, and open-source tools to enhance their teachings. DiLER is a partnership of [DigiTeLL](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106198465/Digital_Teaching_and_Learning_Lab___DigiTeLL) at Goethe University Frankfurt.

This website will guide you through our group session. We will start with discussing the didactic opportunities and benefits of using open and accessible teaching materials. After that, we will talk about the framework that we use to create beautiful, easy-to-deploy, and interactive content quickly. In the individual work session, you will have some time for yourself to create your own course concept, that you will then start to implement with help of a short and easy-to-follow tutorial. 

## What is the structure of this group session?
Our group session is structured as follows: 

**1. Group Session**  
- {doc}`why_oer`  
- {doc}`didactic`
- {doc}`framework`
- {doc}`why_jb`

**2. Independent Work**  
- {doc}`assignment`
- {doc}`../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial_ws`
 
**3. Wrap-Up**
- {doc}`wrap-up`

You will also find an in-depth tutorial on how to create your course website, which provides more detail than the quick setup guide, along with additional resources for you to explore.

You can find all sections in the table of content on the left side. 

## What are the objectives of this group session?

**In this group session, you will**
- Recognize how openness can enhance teaching, learning, and research.
- Think beyond what you teach — focus on how and why to support effective learning.
- Learn how the tools [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be combined to create accessible, interactive, and citable learning materials.
- Take the first concrete steps toward an open, digital course website.

## How did we get here?
We, the DiLER team, believe that education should be available to as many people as possible, which is why this website is created as an open and free resource; if you’d like to create a course following our framework, please consider doing the same. Especially important should be the inclusion (and possibly adaptation) of our [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](../resources/dei), our [open science statement](../resources/open_science), and the [Code of Conduct](../resources/CoC) to promote [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Wilkinson et al., 2016) and inclusive access to education.
   
## Where is everything?

All materials will be available on this very website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an open educational resource. You are free to explore, enhance, and share. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to the end of the internet but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this resource as it is at the moment you’re reading this, you can download the complete course from our GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/luciebinder/ws-openness-2025). The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

We will also be providing a course template that will serve as a tool for our practical examples and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/luciebinder/course-template-minimal). The template contains a folder structure, some example content files, a license, an open science statement, an equity, diversity, and inclusion statement, as well as a code of conduct for your course. This template is supposed to be used as a starting point to generate your own course. Simply add your content or adapt the preexisting resources, adapt the structure to your liking, and upload the whole thing into an online GitHub repository, and your course website will be created automatically.
