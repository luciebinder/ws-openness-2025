Let's discuss: When you reflect on your own teaching, what are didactic challenges you face?

## What are the didactic advantages of our framework? 

Our framework addresses various didactic challenges:

**1. Sustainable and reusable teaching materials**  
**Challenge**: Teaching materials are often stored locally, not version-controlled, and difficult to share or reuse.    
   **Solution**: 
   - GitHub enables **version control**, **collaborative editing**, and **tracking changes** over time.
   - Jupyter Book allows you to publish your materials as **open, citable websites**.
   - Materials become **reusable**, **adaptable**, and **long-lasting**.

**2. Structured and transparent learning paths**    
**Challenge**: Materials like slides or PDFs often lack clear navigation or modular structure.  
**Solution**: 
   - Jupyter Book provides a **clear modular structure** with chapters, sections, and a table of contents.
   - This improves **orientation and coherence** for students.

**3. Open and accessible education**  
**Challenge**: Content is often locked behind institutional platforms (e.g. Moodle, ILIAS), making access difficult for external learners.  
**Solution**: 
   - By publishing on GitHub Pages, your course becomes **freely accessible** to anyone, removing barriers tied to institutional systems.
   - OER licensing supports **legal reuse and sharing**.

**4. Interactive and engaging learning materials**  
**Challenge**: Teaching often relies on static materials (e.g. PDFs, slides), which encourage passive consumption.  
**Solution**:
   - **Interactive code cells, quizzes**, and Jupyter notebooks engage learners more actively.
   - This turns passive materials into **active, hands-on learning opportunities**.

**5. Collaborative course development**   
**Challenge**: Creating and improving teaching materials is often a solitary process.  
**Solution**:  
   - GitHub supports **collaborative work** through issues, pull requests, and version tracking.
   - Colleagues and even students can **contribute and co-create materials**, creating a more dynamic and inclusive process.

**6. Low entry barriers**  
**Challenge**: Educators may hesitate to adopt new tools due to complexity or lack of time.  
**Solution**: 
   - Our **ready-to-use course template** and clear documentation make getting started simple and efficient.
   - Even with limited technical experience, educators can quickly build and maintain high-quality digital courses.


Now, letâ€™s take a closer look at how our framework works.
