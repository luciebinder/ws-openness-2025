# Why use Jupyter Book?

Among the various tools available for creating OERs, why is our approach based on Jupyter Book?

**Great question!**

Jupyter Book is a powerful and flexible tool for creating open and interactive educational content. It is an open source tool that has been developed by the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about), a non-profit and open-source project that aimed to support interactive data science. However, Jupyter Book is agnostic and can be used for any type of content. 

Below are some key reasons to consider using Jupyter Book for your next project:

````{dropdown} 1. Easy formatting
**Text can be easily formatted in Markdown files**  (text), and code can be written in Jupyter notebooks.

Here are some formatting basics:

1) Use hashtags `#` before your heading to create various levels of headings:
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 1.1
### Heading 1.1.1
```

2) Add a `*` before and after a word to make your text *italic* and add `**` to make it **bold**  
`*italic*`--> *italic*  
`**bold**`--> **bold**  


3) Build (nested) lists by using either `*` or `-` before a list item
```
* item 1
* item 2
  - item a
  - item b  
- item 3
```
to create such a list:

* item 1
* item 2
  - item a
  - item b  
- item 3

**Integrate visualizations, audio, videos, live code, equations, citations, cross-references and text seamlessly** into a single document to create an engaging learning experience.

```{dropdown} 3. Collaboration and sharing
**Collaborate and share easily**, thanks to its open-source nature and GitHub integration.

Here, I have added my colleague to the project:

Now, both of us can track all changes (called _commits_) made to the project:

By inspecting a specific commit, we can review the exact changes that were applied:

```

```{dropdown} 4. Interactive elements
**Enhance exercises and quizzes** with interactive elements such as sliders and dropdowns.

When you read this, you already opened a dropdown, that can be used for tips, hints, spoilers, warnings, etc.
```

```{dropdown} 5. Accessibility
**Make your materials accessible across platforms** with multiple export formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB).

You can download this page by clicking on the download button on the upper right side.

```

```{dropdown} 5. Strong community and support
**Rely on a strong community and extensive support**, as Jupyter Book builds on the widely used Jupyter Notebook ecosystem.

Here are, e.g., the [community forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/) and a freely accessible [documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). 
```

By leveraging Jupyter Books, educators can create dynamic, reusable, and interactive learning experiences that align with modern teaching and research needs.
