# Why are we here?

What if your educational resources were not only effective for today’s students but also **accessible**, **citable**, and **reproducible** for future generations? If this prospect aligns with your academic vision, we invite you to explore an alternative approach to traditional learning platforms.

In light of the ongoing replication crisis, many universities are striving to make research and education more **open**, **inclusive**, and **FAIR** (_Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable_). However, conventional educational platforms such as Moodle, OLAT, and ILIAS present significant limitations that are often at odds with these objectives. These proprietary systems introduce several challenges, including **restricted access, high costs, and limited interoperability**. For instance, educators frequently need to acquire costly licenses, which can hinder their ability to develop and disseminate instructional materials freely. Moreover, these platforms often lock users into specific ecosystems, complicating collaboration across institutions and disciplines. These constraints inhibit the dynamic and interactive learning environments necessary for contemporary higher education and research.

# What are the main problems with such an approach?
**Traditional educational platforms present several key issues:**

-    Content is often exclusive and accessible only to a limited group of students.
-    Collaboration on learning materials is constrained.
-    Citability of learning resources is often inadequate.
-    Content must frequently be recompiled for each new cohort.
-    Integration of interactive elements is cumbersome.
-    Content may become fragmented across multiple course iterations, making it difficult to track and update over time.

# An alternative approach: Using Open Educational Resources

To address these challenges, we propose the adoption of **Open Educational Resources (OER)** that are freely accessible, adaptable, and reusable. But how can these be effectively created and maintained?

Our approach leverages open-source tools, including [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), along with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), to facilitate the development and dissemination of reusable educational materials.

Don't worry if you don't nok these tools yet. We will provide a structured introduction within this workshop pages. Our methodology is supported by a [pre-configured template](https://github.com/luciebinder/course-template-minimal) designed to simplify the creation of OERs. This template can be used for diverse learning materials as well as for dynamic publication and documentation (for an example, click [here](https://oreoni.github.io/)).

# What are the benefits of this approach? 

Compared to traditional platforms, the use of this approach provides tangible advantages:

-    Content is **openly accessible** to anyone with an internet connection, independent of institutional affiliation.
-    **Collaboration** is greatly facilitated through GitHub’s **version control** and contribution mechanisms.
-    Educational resources become easily **citable**.
-    Materials can be **reused** and **adapted efficiently**.
-    **Version control** ensures that previous iterations remain **accessible**, enhancing **transparency**.
-    Hosting content via GitHub allows for **centralized management** and **continuous tracking of updates**.

This approach aligns more effectively with the principles of open science and [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) research than conventional approaches.
