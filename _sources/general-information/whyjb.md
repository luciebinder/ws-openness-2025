# Why Use Jupyter Book?

Among the various tools available for creating OERs, why is our approach based on Jupyter Book?

**Great question!**

Jupyter Book is a powerful and flexible tool for creating open and interactive educational content. It is an open source tool that has been developed by the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about), a non-profit and open-source project that aimed to support interactive data science. However, Jupyter Book is agnostic and can be used for any type of content. 

Below are some key reasons to consider using Jupyter Book for your next project:

````{dropdown} 1. **Text can be easily formatted in Markdown files**  (text), and code can be written in Jupyter notebooks.
Here are some formatting basics:

1) Use hashtags `#` before your heading to create various levels of headings:
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 1.1
### Heading 1.1.1
```

2) Add a `*` before and after a word to make your text *italic* and add `**` to make it **bold**  
`*italic*`--> *italic*  
`**bold**`--> **bold**  

3) Build (nested) lists by using either `*` or `-` before a list item
```
* item 1
* item 2
  - item a
  - item b  
- item 3
```
to create such a list:

* item 1
* item 2
  - item a
  - item b  
- item 3

1. **Text can be easily formatted in Markdown files** (text), and code can be written in Jupyter notebooks.
2. **Integrate live code, equations, visualizations, citations, cross-references and text seamlessly** into a single document to create an engaging learning experience.
4. **Collaborate and share easily**, thanks to its open-source nature and GitHub integration.
5. **Enhance exercises and quizzes** with interactive elements such as sliders and dropdowns.
6. **Make your materials accessible across platforms** with multiple export formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB).
7. **Rely on a strong community and extensive support**, as Jupyter Book builds on the widely used Jupyter Notebook ecosystem.

By leveraging Jupyter Books, educators can create dynamic, reusable, and interactive learning experiences that align with modern teaching and research needs.
