# Wrap-Up and Feedback

**Congratulations** on developing your own open course concept and creating the first version of your course website!

During this small group session, we worked towards **four key goals**:

- **Understanding the value of Open Educational Resources (OERs)**  
Recognize how openness can enhance teaching, learning, and research.
- **Designing a course concept that addresses didactic challenges**  
Think beyond _what_ you teach and focus on _how_ and _why_ to support effective learning.
- **Exploring Jupyter Book and GitHub Pages**  
Learn how these tools can be combined to create accessible, interactive, and citable learning materials.
- **Building the foundation of your own course website**  
Take the first concrete steps toward an open, digital course offering.
