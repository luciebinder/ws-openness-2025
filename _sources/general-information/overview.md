# Course overview & Procedure

Now that you've got an idea of what this website is about let's discuss how we'll hopefully get your course up and running. This section will clarify this course's structure and general setup.

The course is divided into several modules, each covering a step in creating your course. The modules include an introduction in GitHub, how you host your course website and how you create and structure your content. You can simply start from the beginning and work your way down through all respective sections. If you're already familiar with the concepts of GitHub and the Jupyter Framework, you can also go to the [Quick Setup Guide](../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial) for a very quick tutorial to creating and hosting your own course.

This tutorial is further paired with a template course that you can find [here](https://github.com/diler-digitell/course-template). We'll, in essence, teach you how to adapt this template to host your own online courses. An explanation of the template can be found in the chapter on [Hosting Your Course Website](../content/2_host/host_website).

## Objectives üìç

**In this group session, you will**
- Recognize how openness can enhance teaching, learning, and research.
- Think beyond what you teach ‚Äî focus on how and why to support effective learning.
- Learn how these tools can be combined to create accessible, interactive, and citable learning materials.
- Take the first concrete steps toward an open, digital course offering.

## Structure of the course

**The course is structured as follows:**

1. Group session
    [Introduction](why_oer)
    [Didactic aspects](didactic)
    [Our framework](framework)
    [Why use Jupyter Book?](why_jb)

2. Independent work
    [Now it‚Äôs your turn!](assignment)
    [Quick Setup Guide](../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial_ws)
3. Wrap-up
    [Wrap-up and feedback](wrap-up)

You will also find an in-depth tutorial on how to create your course website, which provides more detail than the quick setup guide, along with additional resources for you to explore.

You can also find the sections in the Table of Content on the left side.

```{admonition} How do I get all the software needed?
:class: note, dropdown
Everything we'll use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or, at minimum, free of charge and publicly available. Why? Because teaching via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and doesn't align with our values (see our [open science statement](https://diler-digitell.github.io/tutorial_jupyter_books/resources/open_science.html)). We don't want people to have to obtain licenses or be dependent on university resources or pay for software/hosting, etc., out of their own pocket. Additionally, open-source software can do everything, if not more than proprietary software and is furthermore usually better supported, tested, and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community. 

To complete this course and host your own course website, all you need is a GitHub account. How to set it up is explained in the [respective section](../content/1_github/account). If you want to edit your course content locally, you will also need to install Git and a text editor that supports Markdown and Jupyter Notebook files. More information on this can be found in the [additional section on Git](../content/4_additional/git/intro).
```


```{admonition} Where do I find everything?
:class: note, dropdown
All course materials will be available on this very course website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources). You are **free to explore, enhance, and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to the end of the internet but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this resource as it is at the moment you're reading this, you can download the complete course from our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/DiLER-Digitell/tutorial_jupyter_books). The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

We will also be providing a [course template](https://github.com/diler-digitell/course-template) that will serve as a tool for our practical examples. The template contains a folder structure, some example content files, a license, an open science statement, an equity, diversity, and inclusion statement, as well as a code of conduct for your course.
This template is supposed to be used as a starting point to generate your own course. Simply add your content or adapt the preexisting resources, adapt the structure to your liking, and upload the whole thing into an online GitHub repository, and your course website will be created automatically.
```

## How to reach the content creators

If you have questions about course content, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/luciebinder/ws-openness-2025/issues) on the GitHub repository, and I will try and get back to you as soon as possible or simply shoot me an e-mail!

```{admonition} How do we address one another?
:class: dropdown
She/Her. When contacting me, please refrain from using honoraries and formal language, "Lucie" or "you" is fine as long as the content is respectful, fair, and constructive (I aim for the same when I reply).
However, please let me know if you have a preferred way of interacting with other folks, including how you would like to be addressed, your pronouns, and the level of formality.
