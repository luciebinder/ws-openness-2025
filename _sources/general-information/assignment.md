# Now it's your turn!

You’ve just seen the framework and tools that will help you bring your course to life. But before we dive into the technical setup, it’s important to first focus on the **content** of your course.

Let’s start with a short discussion:

- What kind of teaching do you do?
- What kinds of materials and tools have you used so far?
- What challenges have you faced in creating or sharing your teaching materials?

## First task: Develop your course concept
Take the next 50 minutes to draft your own course concept. Please consider the following questions:

- What is the topic of my course?
- Who is my target audience?
- What are the learning goals?
- What teaching materials do I already have that could be used in this course?
- What new materials would I need?
- How can I structure my course so that it is clear and engaging?
- What interactive elements could make my course more interesting (e.g. quizzes, code examples, videos)?
- What challenges or pitfalls might I encounter?

```{tip}
Keep it simple! Your first concept can be a rough draft — you can refine it later when you start building your website.
```

Afterwards, we will come together, and you’ll have the chance to share your ideas and get feedback.


## Second task: Build your course website

Now that you have drafted your course concept, it’s time to start building your own course website.

In the next 50 minutes, please:

- Use our (quick setup guide)[../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial_ws] to help you through the process step-by-step.
- Start adding your first pages and structure to your site — even small steps are great progress!
- Don’t hesitate to ask if you get stuck — I am here to help!

Afterwards, we will meet again for a wrap-up and feedback round, where you can share your experience and ask final questions.
