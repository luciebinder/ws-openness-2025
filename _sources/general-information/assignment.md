# Now It's Your Turn!

## First task: Develop your course concept
Take the next 50 minutes to sketch a first concept for your own course. Focus especially on didactic aspects — not just _what_ you want to teach, but _how_ and _why_. The following guiding questions can help:

- What should students know or be able to do at the end of my course?
- How can I align my content and teaching methods with the skills, needs, and expectations of my target audience?
- How can I organize my content clearly and logically (e.g. modules, chapters)?
- Where can I include opportunities for reflection, review, or guided support?
- Which interactive or hands-on elements (e.g., quizzes, code cells, exercises, multimedia) could actively engage learners?
- How will I provide feedback or guide students’ learning throughout the course?
- What potential challenges might arise (technical, motivational, cognitive), and how can I prepare for them?

```{tip}
Keep it simple! Your first concept can be a rough draft — you can refine it later when you start building your website.
```

Afterwards, we will come together, and you’ll have the chance to share your ideas and get feedback.


## Second task: Build your course website

Now that you have drafted your course concept, it’s time to start building your own course website.

In the next 50 minutes, please:

- Use our (quick setup guide)[../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial_ws] to help you through the process step-by-step.
- Start adding your first pages and structure to your site — even small steps count as great progress!
- Don’t hesitate to ask if you get stuck — I am here to support you!

Afterwards, we’ll come back together for a wrap-up and feedback session, where you can share your experiences and ask any final questions.
