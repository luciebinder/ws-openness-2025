# Now it's your turn!

Letâ€™s start with a short discussion:

- What kind of teaching do you do?
- What kinds of materials and tools have you used so far?
- What challenges have you faced in creating or sharing your teaching materials?

# First step: Develop your course concept
In the next 50 minutes, you will work on creating your own course concept. Please reflect on the following questions as you plan:

- What teaching materials do I already have?
- How easily can I integrate these materials into a course website?
- What challenges or pitfalls might I encounter?
- How can I make my teaching materials more engaging and interactive?

After 50 minutes, we will meet again to discuss your ideas and hear about your concepts.

## Second step: Build your course website

In the following 50 minutes, you will begin creating a course website based on the concept you just developed.  
Please use our (quick setup guide)[../content/4_additional/quick_tutorial_ws] as a starting point, and feel free to ask for help at any time if you get stuck!

At the end, we will come together for a wrap-up and feedback session to share experiences.
