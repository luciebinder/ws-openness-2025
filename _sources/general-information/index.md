# **Welcome!**

Hello and welcome everyone to our course **Creating interactive content with Jupyter Books** created as part of [DigiTeLL](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106198465/Digital_Teaching_and_Learning_Lab___DigiTeLL), by the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/intro.html) project. Our project aims to provide open and free educational resources to promote key digital skills for working in empirical sciences. At the same time, we empower course instructors to take advantage of interactive, flexible, and open-source tools to enhance their teachings.

As you read through the subsections of this website, you will gain insight into how to create beautiful, easy-to-deploy, and interactive content quickly. Simply follow the outline discussed in the [Course Overview & Procedure section](overview) to learn what this course is about and how to navigate the materials.

While this tutorial was created with the goal of an integrated framework for digital education at Goethe University, this doesn't limit the content to members of Goethe University: We utilize free, open-source software available to anyone.

## What Is the Aim of This Course?
In this online course, we first want to emphasise the benefits of free and accessible online courses and why they should be of interest to lecturers/trainers. Then, you will learn how to create your own free online resources using our course template. 

## Our Commitment to Open Education
We believe that education should be available to as many people as possible, which is why this website is created as an open and free resource; if you'd like to create a course following our framework, please consider doing the same. Especially important should be the inclusion (and possibly adaptation) of our [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](../resources/dei), our [open science statement](../resources/open_science), and the [Code of Conduct](../resources/CoC) to promote fair and inclusive access to education.
