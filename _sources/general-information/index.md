# **Welcome!**

Hello and welcome everyone to the introduction page of our group session on "**Working collaborative with Jupyter Book: An open-source tool to create open and flexible teaching/learning materials**", at the "Openness in the Higher Education Classroom" Workshop on June 30th, 2025.  

My name is Lucie Binder, I'm a phd student at Goethe University and I'm also part of the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/intro.html) project that aims to provide open and free educational resources to promote key digital skills for working in empirical sciences. At the same time, we empower course instructors to take advantage of interactive, flexible, and open-source tools to enhance their teachings. DiLER is a partnership of [DigiTeLL](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106198465/Digital_Teaching_and_Learning_Lab___DigiTeLL) at Goethe University Frankfurt.

This website will guide you through our group session. We will start with an introduction into the framework that we use to create beautiful, easy-to-deploy, and interactive content quickly. Following, we will discuss the opportunities and benefits of using this framework for open, accessible, and inclusive teaching. Then, you will have some time for yourself to create your own course concept, that you will then start to implement with help of a short and easy-to-follow tutorial. 

Simply follow the outline discussed in the [Course Overview & Procedure section](overview) to learn what this course is about and how to navigate the materials.

# What is the goal of our group session?
You will learn about the advantages of using open educational resources, as well as how to create them using [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).

# Why are we using these tools?
To make learning materials **accessible**, **reusable** and **transparent**. Furthermore, these tools enhance the possibility for **collaboration**.

# Why shouldn’t we use proprietary software?
Proprietary means have several shortcomings, such as **limited access**, **high costs**, and **lack of interoperability**.

# What should have changed at the end of this course?
You will have developed your own course concept and set up your own course by using our course template.

# How did we get here?
We believe that education should be available to as many people as possible, which is why this website is created as an open and free resource; if you’d like to create a course following our framework, please consider doing the same. Especially important should be the inclusion (and possibly adaptation) of our [diversity, equity, and inclusion statement](../resources/dei), our [open science statement](../resources/open_science), and the [Code of Conduct](../resources/CoC) to promote [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Wilkinson et al., 2016) and inclusive access to education.
   
# How do we proceed?
- Introduction to Open Educational Resources
- Introduction in Jupyter Book and GitHub pages
  - What is possible?
  - How is the whole thing structured?
- Create your own course concept
- Set up your own course website with help of our template and our practical guide
- Summary/Discussion

# Where is everything?

All course materials will be available on this very website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an open educational resource. You are free to explore, enhance, and share. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to the end of the internet but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this resource as it is at the moment you’re reading this, you can download the complete course from our GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/luciebinder/ws-openness-2025). The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.

We will also be providing a course template that will serve as a tool for our practical examples and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/luciebinder/course-template-minimal). The template contains a folder structure, some example content files, a license, an open science statement, an equity, diversity, and inclusion statement, as well as a code of conduct for your course. This template is supposed to be used as a starting point to generate your own course. Simply add your content or adapt the preexisting resources, adapt the structure to your liking, and upload the whole thing into an online GitHub repository, and your course website will be created automatically.
