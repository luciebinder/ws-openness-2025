# **Welcome!**

-- under construction --

Hello and welcome everyone to our group session on "**Working collaborative with Jupyter Book: An open-source tool to create open and flexible teaching/learning materials**" at the Workshop "Openness in the Higher Education Classroom" (June 30th, 2025).  

My name is Lucie Binder and I'm part of the [DiLER](https://diler-digitell.github.io/intro.html) project, which is a partnership of [DigiTeLL](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106198465/Digital_Teaching_and_Learning_Lab___DigiTeLL) at Goethe University Frankfurt. Our project aims to provide open and free educational resources to promote key digital skills for working in empirical sciences. At the same time, we empower course instructors to take advantage of interactive, flexible, and open-source tools to enhance their teachings.

This website will guide you through our group session. We will start with an introduction into the framework that we use to create beautiful, easy-to-deploy, and interactive content quickly. Following, we will discuss the opportunities and benefits of using this framework for open, accessible, and inclusive teaching. Then, you will have some time for yourself to create your own course concept, that you will then start to implement with help of a short and easy-to-follow tutorial. 

Simply follow the outline discussed in the [Course Overview & Procedure section](overview) to learn what this course is about and how to navigate the materials.
